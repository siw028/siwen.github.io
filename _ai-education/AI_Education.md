## Overview

In this panel I share some of my thoughts about how AI would affect future education, and the changes I made to my course curriculum design to better train and prepare students for the fast-changing world.

### Resource 1: Introduction to AI in Education

A comprehensive introduction to the field of artificial intelligence and education, covering:
* Definition and history of AI
* Recent advances in Large Language Models
* Changes in Higher Education
* Updated APCSA curriculum
* Student feedback
* Guidelines and ethical concerns
* LLM safety research

This resource is particularly valuable for teachers from non-technical backgrounds seeking a general overview of AI and LLMs.

### Resource 2: Practical LLM Applications

A curated summary based on Andrej Karpathy's "How I use LLMs" talk, adapted specifically for AP curriculum teachers. This presentation includes:
* General ways to use LLMs
* Creating review guides for students
* Additional applications in education

Recommended for educators (or just anyone in general) who have basic LLM experience but want to explore advanced applications.

> **Note:** For a deeper understanding, I highly recommend watching the original 2-hour video by Andrej Karpathy. It's a blessing to everyone where an accomplished researcher shares his knowledge freely and accessibly.
